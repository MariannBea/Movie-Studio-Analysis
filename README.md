# Movie Studio Analysis
Is it possible to predict if a movie will earn in the top 25% of profits? If so, what features are useful in making this prediction.  That is what this project aims to find out.

## Project Description
My goal was to see if I could predict if a film will be in the top 25% of profitability for the year, using factors that movie studios could consider when planning a movie project.  

These are the specific research questions I aimed to answer:

1.	Is there a correlation between genre and profits?
2.	Is there a correlation between content rating and profits?
3.	Are some genres more profitable for specific content ratings?
4.	Does an increase in the number of Facebook likes for directors or actors correlate with increased profits?
5.	Is being in or directing a greater number of movies correlated with more profits?
6.	Are some topics correlated with more profits?
